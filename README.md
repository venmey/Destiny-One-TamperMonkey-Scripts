# Destiny One TamperMonkey Scripts
A series of TamperMonkey scripts written to modify the Destiny One user interface.

1. floatingButtons.user.js - Creates a floating save button at the bottom of the screen whenever the actual save button is not visible. Makes it easier to save your changes at any time without needing to scroll to the real save button or remember the correct keyboard shortcut.

2. makeDestinyTestBlue - Changes the color scheme of the Destiny One TEST environment to blue to help distinguish it from PROD.

3. showCsn - Adds a checkbox on the Enrollment Manager > Courses > Historical and Enrollment Manager > Courses > Enrolled pages when a student is in context that allows you to toggle between displaying the Course and Section Code (default Destiny One behavior) and the Custom Section Number.
