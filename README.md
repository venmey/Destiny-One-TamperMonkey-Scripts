# Destiny One TamperMonkey Scripts
This GitHub repository contains a series of TamperMonkey scripts written to modify the Destiny One user interface. Before you can use the scripts, visit the [TamperMonkey homepage](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and install the extension for your favorite browser. You can then use the links below to add a specific script to your browser. Full instructions are available in the [Destiny One TamperMonkey Userscripts guide](https://ucdavis.app.box.com/file/745737709189)

1. [floatingButtons.user.js](https://github.com/venmey/Destiny-One-TamperMonkey-Scripts/raw/main/floatingButtons.user.js) - Creates a floating save button at the bottom of the screen whenever the actual save button is not visible. Makes it easier to save your changes at any time without needing to scroll to the real save button or remember the correct keyboard shortcut.

2. [makeDestinyTestBlue](https://github.com/venmey/Destiny-One-TamperMonkey-Scripts/raw/main/makeDestinyTestBlue.user.js) - Changes the color scheme of the Destiny One TEST environment to blue to help distinguish it from PROD.

3. [showCsn](https://github.com/venmey/Destiny-One-TamperMonkey-Scripts/raw/main/showCsn.user.js) - Adds a checkbox on the Enrollment Manager > Courses > Historical and Enrollment Manager > Courses > Enrolled pages when a student is in context that allows you to toggle between displaying the Course and Section Code (default Destiny One behavior) and the Custom Section Number.

4. [favIcons](https://github.com/venmey/Destiny-One-TamperMonkey-Scripts/raw/main/favIcons.user.js) - Adds a favicon (little icon in the top left-corner of the tab) when you visit either the Destiny One TEST or PROD staff view.
